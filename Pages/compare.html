        <div class="paraLast">The ability to measure blood oxygen is no longer available on Apple Watch units sold by Apple in the United States beginning January 18, 2024. These are indicated with part numbers ending in LW/A. Learn how to identify your Apple Watch. ◊ Apple
            Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com(Opens in a new window), the Apple Store app, or
            by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/102730(Opens in a new window) for more information about eligible products. Existing customers: See your Customer Agreement for your variable
            APR. As of January 1, 2025, the variable APR on new Apple Card accounts ranges from 18.24% to 28.49%. You must elect to use ACMI at checkout. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product with a one-time payment on Apple Card at checkout, that purchase
            is subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on items purchased using ACMI are subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. In order to buy an iPhone with ACMI, you must select one
            of the following carriers: AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time, subject to your carrier’s terms. ACMI is not available for purchases made online
            at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last
            month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible
            products. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement(Opens in a new window) for more information about ACMI. ◊◊ Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are eligible
            for credit. You must be at least the age of majority to be eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded
            is based on receipt of a qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may
            require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online trade-in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse, cancel,
            or limit quantity of any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available from Apple’s trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply. * Monthly pricing is available when
            you select Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) as payment type at checkout at Apple, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Financing terms vary by product. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI and are subject to your
            card’s variable APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement(Opens in a new window) for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at special storefronts. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s
            purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens
