            <h2>THE IDEA</h2>

                Apple Watch was created to bring powerful technology to your wrist in a way that’s personal and accessible. Combining health, communication, and seamless iPhone integration, the Apple Watch empowers users to stay connected, track wellness goals, and simplify

                As the wearable market grew, Apple saw a need for a product that could do more than just tell time. It became a fitness tracker, heart monitor, and even a life-saving device with features like fall detection and emergency SOS. Apple Watch is not just
                a smartwatch — it's a statement of innovation, design, and purpose.
